# EpXL
A macro-enabled Microsoft Excel spreadsheet user-interface to the EnergyPlus™ whole-building energy simulation program (https://energyplus.net/). Developed as a result of frustration over the other user-interfaces, including the standard Energy Plus IDF editor, and overcomes the impossible task of editing .IDF text files directly. Will i future be converted to JSON output with the possibility for batch-automation for parametric studies.
